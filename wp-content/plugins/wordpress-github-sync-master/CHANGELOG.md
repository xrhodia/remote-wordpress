## Changelog ##

This change log follows the [Keep a Changelog standards][]. Versions follows [Semantic Versioning][].

### [2.0.0][] ###

* **POSSIBLY BREAKING**: Remove handling of custom post meta
    * If you were relying on WPGHS to export custom post meta, use `wpghs_post_meta` filter & `wpghs_pre_import_meta` to handle the meta yourself. See the [documentation][] for more information.
* Switch from `sanitize_title` to `sanitize_file_name`.
    * This should ensure better fidelity to the original filename.
* Don't export `post_date` if post isn't published.
    * `post_date` means the time the post was published. If it's not published, it shouldn't have a `post_date`.
* Overwrite post_date from markdown, allowing remote user to modify publish date.

### [1.7.5][] ###

* Fix plugin slug (props @gmays)

### [1.7.2][] ###

* Fix messages (props @synchrophoto!)
* Fix Markdown when importing w/ Jetpack (props @lite3!)
* Fix bug in HTTP request on 4.6+
* Update dependencies

### [1.7.0][] ###

* Add GitHub link shortcode (props @jonocarroll!)
* Add boot hook (props @kennyfraser!)

### [1.6.1][] ###

* Fixed bug where post_meta with the same name as built-in meta keys were getting overwritten

### [1.6.0][] ###

* New filters:
    * `wpghs_pre_fetch_all_supported`: Filter the query args before all supported posts are queried.
    * `wpghs_is_post_supported`: Determines whether the post is supported by importing/exporting.
* Bugfix: Set secret to password field. See [#124].
* Bugfix: Fix error when importing branch-deletion webhooks.
* Bugfix: Fix "semaphore is locked" response from webhook. See [#121].
* Bugfix: Correctly display import/export messages in settings page. See [#127].
* Bugfix: Correctly set if post is new only when the matching ID is found in the database.

### [1.5.1][] ###

* Added Chinese translation (props @malsony!).
* Updated German translation (props @lsinger!).
* Expire semaphore lock to avoid permanently locked install.

### [1.5.0][] ###

* New WP-CLI command:
    * `prime`: Forces WPGHS to fetch the latest commit and save it in the cache.
* New filters:
    * `wpghs_sync_branch`: Branch the WordPress install should sync itself with.
    * `wpghs_commit_msg_tag`: Tag appended to the end of the commit message. Split from message with ` - `. Used to determine if commit has been synced already.
* These two new filters allow you to use WPGHS to keep multiple sites in sync.
    * This is an _advanced feature_. Your configuration may or may not be fully supported. **Use at your own risk.**
* Eliminated some direct database calls in exchange for WP_Query usage.

    * Called before post arguments are passed for an imported post.
* New filter: `wpghs_pre_import_meta`
    * Called before post meta is imported from a post.
* BREAKING: Remove reference to global `$wpghs` variable.
    * Use `WordPress_GitHub_Sync::$instance` instead.
